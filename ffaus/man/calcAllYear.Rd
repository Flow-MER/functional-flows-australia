\arguments{
\item{flow_matrix}{A 'by date' row data frame with 2 columns named (Date, Flow).}

\item{max_nan_allowed_per_year}{Maximum number of NA days per-year allowed. Recommend imputing NAs prior to running ffaus functions.}

\item{do_plot}{Should diagnostic plots be generated? 1 = yes, 0 = no.}

\item{user_q10_thresh}{A user defined 10th percentile threshold value.
In the same units of flow as in flow_matrix.}

\item{user_q25_thresh}{A user defined 25th percentile threshold value.
In the same units of flow as in flow_matrix.}

\item{user_q50_thresh}{A user defined 50th percentile threshold value.
In the same units of flow as in flow_matrix.}

\item{user_q75_thresh}{A user defined 75th percentile threshold value.
In the same units of flow as in flow_matrix.}

In the same units of flow as in flow_matrix.}
